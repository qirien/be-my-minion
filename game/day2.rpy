    n "Ssssen anything interesting today Princessss?"
    p "No, it’s all been very dull. And now it’s become tedious as well. What do you want?"
    n "I sssupect the question should be to you.  What do {i}you{/i} want?"
    n "You came here, acting ssssupicious in the first place."
    p "I need something powerful. Something that will make it clear that I am the rightful Queen. If you don’t have anything like that, then away with you."
    n "More powerful than a dragon?  My aren’t you ambitioussss?"
    p "It doesn’t take much to be more powerful than you right now."

    n "I know sssssecrets of all kindsss.  And not just about the cassstle."
    n "I could find you ssssomething powerful.  But what would you do for me in return?"
    p "Why, I would help you gain your freedom, so you could continue to serve me."
    n "That doesn’t ssssound like a very good deal."
    p "It sounds good to me. Do you have a better idea?"
    n "..."
    p "No? Then perhaps I’ll just go and ask Cyril. He probably knows more than you do about the ‘ssssecrets’, anyway."

    n "Thissss way."

    n "Why do care about the kingdom anyway?  What hasss the kingdom done for you?"
    p "Nothing, yet. That’s why I need to be Queen."
    p "Surely you can understand wanting greater power and recognition?"
    n "There are other wayssss of getting power.  Much more amusing ways, than dealing with royalty." 
    p "The throne should be mine! It {b}is{/b} mine! My sister is not fit to rule! If my father can’t see that--"
    n "Ssso you just want to take it?"
    p "It is my {b}right{/b}! I was born to be QUEEN!!"
    n "I don’t care about that.  But I am interessssted in you jussst taking it."
    p "Good. By the way, isn’t this the way to the [insert boring place here]? Where are you taking me?"
    n "We have to go through the [place].  Patiencccce."
    p "Now you’re starting to sound like my father! You don’t usually sound like my father, though. He doesn’t seem to care what I wear or what I do or what I want at all."
    n "Ssssounds heartbreaking, princessss.  I don’t care either.  But I want to find out what your plansss are, as it seems like you don’t have any."
    n "Watching you fail could be entertaining."
    p "Hmph. That’s no way to talk to your future Queen."
    n "My queen?  Ha ha ha ha.  I am a dragon.  I have no queen."
    p "Cyril might as well be your queen, since he controls where you can go and keeps you in human form. I wouldn’t be so cruel."
    n "He is rather pretty."
    n "But you, are ssslightly more becoming.  Just ssslightly."
    p "Yes, well, it is a queenly duty to look becoming… though my presence would certainly be improved if I had my full royal wardrobe. Are we there yet?"
    n "Ssssoon.  Hmmm.  Where is this royal wardrobe of yoursss?"
    p "Back at {b}my{/b} castle, which I must say is in much better repair than this one. Why, did you want to try something on?"
    n "I will if you do."
    p "I think you would look fabulous inside a wardrobe."
    n "Perhapsss.  Why leave sssuch a lovely wardrobe behind? " 
    p "I left in a bit of a...hurry."
    n "And you may never go back."
    p "Of course I’m going back! But when I go back, it shall be with such power and magnificence that they will have no choice but to accept me as Queen! I had thought to find something useful here, but it seems there’s only dusty old rooms and dusty old dragons."
    n "Leaving issss not alwaysss an option.  Not just for dragonsss either.  I might make it my misssion to keep you here."
    p "Hmph. Well, then your mission will need to include renovating this castle, finding me a new wardrobe, making me a queen, and making yourself...less of a nuisance. I’m not sure you can handle all that, particularly the last requirement. Though, if you could...hmmm"
    n "Ahhh, ssseems it took less persuasion than I originally thought."
    p "I am not persuaded of anything, yet. Show me you are capable, however, and then I will decide."
    n "It would make things a little more entertaining.  I think I’ve worn Balrung down to the bone.  He isss less interesssting company than he initially wassss."
    n "What is your cassstle like?  Better than thisss?"
    p "Obviously. Though, this castle does have a certain… gravity that is hard to find in a castle these days. My castle was- {b}is{/b} full of light, with stained glass scenes of my ancestors’ achievements, and every comfort a queen deserves."
    n "Perhapsss I will consider helping you take that one inssstead.  But you ssstill haven’t made me a good enough deal.  What will we do with thissss father of yourss if I help you take it?"
    p "Father? Well, I… he… what do you care what I do with my father?!"
    n "Oh, a sssore spot.  Fathersss usually are.  At leassst you have not had to deal with a dragon father."
    p "What is your father like?"
    n "I don’t remember, usss dragonsss do not have strong paternal bondsss.  But ever since I arrived here Balrung hasss been like my father.  And every time I try to be rid of him, it sssseems I am ssstuck with him, in this form.  We dragonsss would rather not have such submisssion to parental figures."
    p "He wants you to be something you’re not."
    n "It sssseems in two dayss you understand me more than he."
    p "We do have a few things in common. What will you do once you’re free? Besides serve my every whim, of course."
    n "I’ll pretend you didn’t ssssay that."
    n "..."
    n "I don’t remember tasssting true freedom.  It hasss been too long."
    p "..."
    p "That’s sooo dull! Surely you can think of {b}something{/b}? Flying around a volcano, or devouring a herd of sheep, or decimating an enemy castle? Actually, you’ll need to leave the castle in good enough condition that I can inherit it; just do enough damage to scare everyone out of it."
    n "Who {b}are{/b} you Princessss?  You ssssurely do not act like any princess that I have ssseen."
    p "Let me guess; all the princesses you’ve met were the demure, gentle type that pretend they wouldn’t hurt a fly, but actually scheme behind their sister’s back to steal away their kingdom? I know the type."
    n "The princessesss did not tell me to devour ssssheep or decimate a cassstle.  If that isss the type.  I thought it wasssn’t ‘regal’ to sssugest such thingsss.  Won’t your people be displeasssed with your hearty appetite for destruction?"
        p "It’s not destruction I crave, but the throne! And if a little poison fails to do the trick, then perhaps I’ll try a little dragon fire."
    "(Oops! Did I mention the poison?!)"
    n "Poissson?  I will keep it in mind the next time you put a tasssty morsssel in front of my nossse."
    p "A-a-anyway, is this the place you wanted to show me?"
    n "Not yet!  Princesss!  We are almossst there.  I just got… dissstracted."
    n "Thisss way."
    n "Here."

    p "I thought you were going to show me something powerful?!"
    n "Sssomething that makesss me feel powerful."
    p "That’s not what I meant! I need something that can make me Queen!"
    n "Have you ever flown before Princesss?"
    p "Of course not. Do I look like a dragon to you?"
        n "Then you do not truly know what power issss."
        n "Maybe sssome day-"
    p "What are you really like, Niir? Honestly, it’s hard to imagine you being intimidating or flying or anything like that."
    n "..."

    p "..."
