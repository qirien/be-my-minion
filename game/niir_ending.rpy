    p "Niir!  I’m warning you.  You have been asleep for two weeks!  You have made me miss my sister’s coronation.  You will pay for that, I assure you."
    p "And what’s worse is that I’ve been out here.  Miserable.  Having to get food for myself!  Foraging, Niir.  Foraging!  All because you are a useless dragon who won’t WAKE UP!"
    p "I can’t believe I even freed you, you know.  To think that I almost deluded myself that I lo-"
    p "Wait.  You’re moving?"
    p "Niir?"

    n "My head.  It hurtsssss."
