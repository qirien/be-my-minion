    scene hall with fade
    c "Niir!  Get back here you {i}dragon!{/i}  I’m not playing games this time!  I’m all green now.  Niir just stay in one place so I can- so I can." 
    p "Moronious, why do you allow Niir to play with you like that? You should use your magic to teach him a lesson. Show your strength and he will think twice before bothering you again!"
    c “The council doesn’t approve of magic used for frivolous things such as… getting even.  And besides, what can a green mage do, like this?”
    p "Can't you turn him into a squirrel, or paralyze him, or make him feel like he's fallen into poison nettle?"
    c “Paralyze?  Poison… squirrel?!  Absolutely not!  Positively absolutely assuredly not.  {i}It’s not as if I don’t want to…{/i} but I am under oath to protect these dragons!”
    p "But you shouldn't have to endure such humiliation! Surely the council would look the other way..."
    c “I thank you for your concern Princess.  I am grateful for that.  But what can I do?  I have my standing before the council to think of and do not think they would let the matter go lightly.”
    p "Well, if you aren't going to do anything about it, perhaps I will!"
    c “I wouldn’t-they’re, they’re dragons milady!  And one should know better than to take on a dragon.  Though I do appreciate the sentiment I absolutely cannot allow it.”
    p “You cannot {b}allow{/b} it? Perhaps I am mistaken, but it sounds as though you were trying to command YOUR future Queen? Surely even you would not be so ludicrously unintelligent.”
    c “Oh no.  That wasn’t what i was intending at all.  I was just-if anything were to happen to you over my own foolishness your majesty I would never be able to forgive myself.”
    p “That’s your concern, not mine. Stay here. That is an {b}order{/b}!”

    scene library with fade
    p “I know I saw something around here… ah-hah! \”Perfect Potion Pranks\”, just the sort of book every mage library needs! I’ll need something without too many complicated ingredients…”

    scene kitchen with fade
    p “Carrot tops, rat droppings, a smashed glass… this is servant’s work! I must see to getting a royal Potion maker… hmmm, but then I’d have to have a Potion Maker Supervisor to ensure he didn’t poison me… and then a supervisor for the supervisor...perhaps it’s best if I just continue to make them myself.”

    scene bg dungeon with fade
    show niir at midright with dissolve
    n “Do I sssmell..?”
    p “Niir, meet me at the castle gates in five minutes. I have something I want to show you that you will find VERY interesting.”
    n “Interessssssting.  I have been waiting for interesssting.”
    hide niir with moveoutleft
    “(Now, I’ll just sprinkle this in his sheets...Ahhh!)”
    show balrung at midright with moveinright
    b “Princess? Can I assist you?”
    p “No, no, no assistance needed, thank you.”
    “He glanced at the flask in my hands and smiled.”
    b “I believe I feel quite tired. I will be asleep and shall not see or hear anything.”
    “(Hmph, well, so much for secrecy. Still, now’s my chance!)”
    “(There! He’ll have quite a surprise when he gets in bed tonight! \”Interesting\” indeed, mwah ha ha ha ha ha ha!)”
    b “I suggest you return to your room before commencing with gleeful cackling, Princess.”
    p “I shall return when I am ready! Oh, and Balrung, if Niir is looking for me, please tell him I’ll be in the hall.”
    b “Very well. I hope you are successful in your endeavors.”

    scene hall with fade
    show cyril at midright with dissolve
    p “Well, that was the most fun I’ve had since poisoning my sis- I mean, passing my sister the ball in croquet!”
    c “Croquet you say?  I have always been meaning to play that…”
    (delightfully oblivious haha).
    p “Don’t bother. It’s dreadfully dull. Did you know you’re not supposed to hit the other players, only the balls? Who invented that game?!”
    c “Oh well, yes.  I think the purpose is to… how do you propose that it’s played?  Perhaps we can invent a new sport and name it after you [p-name].”
    p “An excellent idea. There should certainly be bludgeoning involved, and perhaps pilfering? Alchemy? Princess-worship?”
    c “Ah, that sounds like a very interesting sport ind-”
    n “Princesssssss.  It musssst have been you, Princessssss.”
    p “Niir? Why are you dancing around like a festival girl? I don’t dance, you know, and it’s unbecoming to dance alone.”
    n “I am not danccccccing.  Thissss isss magic.  Some of hissss magic.”
    c “Don’t look at me!  Though it is quite amusing to see this side of you Niir.”
    p “Yes, I take back what I said earlier. This dancing suits you, much like a fool’s motley suits him.”
    n “Ahhh, what issss thisss?  I jusssst need to ssscratch…”
    n “End it!  End it now!”
    p “Well, I don’t know any magic, but Cyril is an absurdly kind magician...perhaps if you begged him, he might assist you?”
    p “Although… he might be a bit cross about the whole dyeing-him-green incident. You might have to grovel. Or you could continue your itching dance; I’m enjoying it.”
    n  “Begged?  I will not- ahhh!  It itchessss.  I will get you for thissss mage.”
    c “Just hold on.  I’ll think of something that can help you.”
    c “If only I had my spellbook on hand…”
    p “If only we knew where it was.”
    n “I’ll find your sssstupid ssspellbook if you get this sssspell off of me!”
    hide niir with moveoutleft

    p “Aha ha ha ha ha ha! Did you enjoy that as much as I did, Cyril?” 
    c “That was quite dev- wait.  Cyril?  You called me Cyril!”
    p “Of course I did. That’s your name, isn’t it?”
    c “Ah, yes you’re right, my-your majesty.  That is correct.  I am Cyril - to you - which I couldn’t be happier about.  So what did you do exactly?”
    p “Me? I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
    c “Ah, that must have been some magic indeed.  I think someone, somewhere must be punishing that misbehaving dragon for his misdeeds.”
    p “It’s all very mysterious.”
    c “Well, to whomever did it, I would like to extend my gratitude.”
    p “Yes, yes. Now, can’t you find some way to rid your skin of that disgusting green color? It’s making me ill.”
    c “Ah yes.  As soon as that dragon brings me that spellbook of mine, that is the first thing I’ll do.”
    c “And if he’s nice, perhaps I’ll help him out too.”
    show niir
    n “I have your sssspellbook mage.”
    n “Now sssstop this infernal sssscratching.”
    c “I’ll just need to find a different spell first.  Something to rectify what was first wrong.”
    p “Cyril! He didn’t beg. He should at least say \”please\”.”
    c “Yes, very true.  I do think that is the least he can do after all this trouble.”
    n “Pleassse?  You mussst be jo-oh!   “
    extend “Pleassssse.  Pleassssse.”
    c “Here it is! Dermis Claro!”
    n “That doessssn’t help me, ussseless mage.”
    p “Perhaps you should kneel.”
    n “I will not kneel.  I will NOT!”[ideas for what to write?]
    c “Okay, I think that’s enough.  I’m looking for the spell now.  It itches right?  Any rash anywhere?”
    n “Yesss, I need to sssratch.  Here.  Sssee for yoursssself.”
    p “Ha ha ha, I will never forget this.”
    c “This should do the trick - Pruritus Termine!“
    n “I will not forget thissss.”
    c “I do believe you have learned your lesson, Niir.  And there will be no more of that stealing books business, or turning people green, or making them slip, or sneaking something under the door when they are sleeping.  No more of that.”
    n “Ssssay what you like. I’ll do as I pleasssse.”
    hide niir with moveoutleft
    c “It didn’t seem like he learned anything from all that.  Quite disappointing.”
    p “You mean entertaining! Perhaps he’ll at least think twice before bothering people.”
    c “That is true, Princess.  You always do know how to look on the bright side of things.  I do find your perspective like a breath of fresh air around here.”
    p “Ha! I approve of your flattery. That is a skill I prize in all my minions.”
    c “Minions?  Oh, yes.  Of course.  How could I have deluded myself into thinking anything but… I am honored to be anything to you, even a minion your majesty.”
    p “Don’t look so disappointed. You are my favorite minion...at the moment.”
    c “Favorite? I-I do say.”
    p “You may kiss my cheek, if you wish.”
    c “Oh, I wasn’t expect- thank you Princess.  It would be my honor.”
